Harry Potter is the central protagonist of J.K. Rowling's seven-novel fantasy series, 
published between 1997 and 2007, depicting a young orphan who discovers his innate magical 
abilities and confronts existential threats within a hidden wizarding society parallel to 
the non-magical (Muggle) world.

Born on 31 July 1980 to pure-blood wizard father James Potter and Muggle-born mother 
Lily Potter, Harry becomes an infant survivor of the Killing Curse cast by the dark wizard 
Lord Voldemort, an event that disfigures him with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead 
and strips Voldemort of his body, granting Harry the moniker "The Boy Who Lived" in 
wizarding lore.

Relegated to an abusive upbringing with his Muggle aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, 
who suppress any hint of his heritage, Harry receives an invitation to Hogwarts School 
of Witchcraft and Wizardry at age 11, where he learns spellcasting, potion-making, and 
broomstick flight amid rivalries and mysteries.

His defining traits include unyielding courage, as sorted into Gryffindor house, 
fierce loyalty to friends like Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and a propensity 
for rule-breaking driven by moral imperatives rather than rebellion for its own sake.

Over the series, Harry unravels a prophecy marking him as Voldemort's destined vanquisher, 
uncovers family secrets through artifacts like the Invisibility Cloak and Resurrection 
Stone, and leads the resistance against Voldemort's return, culminating in a sacrificial 
confrontation that exploits the dark wizard's hubris and magical miscalculations.
