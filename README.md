# Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises, mini-projects, and practice scripts developed as part of my self-directed learning journey.  
The goal of this repository is to improve my programming fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and understanding of Python for real-world applications.

## What This Repository Includes

### Python Fundamentals
- Variables, data types, operators  
- Conditionals and loops  
- Functions and modules  
- File handling (read/write)  
- Error handling  

### Mini Projects
- **Task Manager CLI** – create, list, update, and store tasks using JSON  
- **Shopping List Manager** – persistent CLI application using file I/O  
- **Mini Grade System** – input grades, calculate statistics, store results  
- **Enhanced Task System** – categorized task scheduler with validation  

### NumPy Projects
- **Statistical Analyzer** – mean, median, variance, std, percentiles  
- **Matrix Operations** – slicing, multiplication, transpose, algebra  
- **Dataset Normalizer** – Min-Max and Z-Score normalization  

### Pandas Projects
- **CSV Analyzer (EDA)** – load CSVs, inspect structure, describe statistics  
- **Data Cleaning Pipeline** – handle missing values, rename, filter, cast types  
- **GroupBy + Advanced Stats** – grouped aggregations and multi-index ops  

### Matplotlib Projects
- Line plots, bar charts, scatterplots  
- Statistical visualization dashboards  
- Comparative performance charts  

## Tech & Libraries Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- JSON / File I/O

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository reflects my **independent learning** and continuous practice to strengthen my programming foundations.  
It serves as a personal coding portfolio showing my progress from basic scripting to data analysis and visualization tools.

## Future Improvements
- Add unit tests  
- Convert some scripts into modular packages  
- Add interactive menus to CLI tools  
- Extend EDA automation features
